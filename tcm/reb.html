      <p><strong>Eric "Reb" Harris</strong></p>
      <p>Eric David Harris (called "Reb" by himself and Klebold) was born April 9th, 1981. He was born to Wayne Nelson Harris and Katherine (Kathy) Ann (Poole) Harris in Wichita, Kansas. His family had moved many times on account of his father being in the Air Force. The final place his family moved before living in Colorado was Plattsburgh, New York.</p>
      <p>While living in New York, Harris had seemed like a good, normal kid. He had played baseball, and had friends. Once moving to Littleton, however, he began to change slightly (1993). He had gone from baseball to soccer and also had trouble fitting in at his new school. </p>
      <p>Ken Caryl Middle School is where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had met (7th/8th grade) and quickly became good friends. In their sophomore year of high school (1997), Harris and Klebold were arrested for breaking into a van. Both were released early, however, due to how well they did in the juvenile diversion program they had to attend.</p>
      <p>That same year, Harris and Klebold found a job at Blackjack Pizza. Together Eric and Dylan got into a lot of mischief at Blackjack Pizza: They set off fireworks in the back alley, they booby-trapped the fence, and they even set a fire in the sink of the kitchen once.</p>
      <p>In January of 1998, Eric and Dylan broke into a van and stole a bunch of electronic equipment. They were caught and sentenced to community service via Juvenile Diversion. Eric was very mad about this and ranted about it in one of his diary entries. To his parents and the judge, though, he presented a remorseful image and was even released early from his sentence. Around the same time his mother started taking him to a therapist for his anger management issues.</p>
      <p>Harris had ambitions of joining the Marines, but was rejected shortly before the shooting. His rejection is likely caused by the drug Luvox, which had been prescribed to him for his anger management.</p>
      <p>Eric was very active on the internet during the years preceding the shootings, exploring what was then a new frontier as the internet was still very new. Judy Brown, mother to Brooks, said she would often be driving down the block and there he'd be, sitting in front of the computer so often that she wondered if it was healthy for him to be spending so much time on it. He and Dylan had their computers set up on a network to play Doom together online though it was Eric who had the stronger web presence. Eric's (aka REB, Rebel, Rebdoomer, Rebdomine) webpages received a lot of attention immediately following the shootings, particularly the rants that were released years after the investigation ended.</p>
      <p>In the months prior to the shootings, Eric and Dylan both recorded on video quite a bit about what they wanted to do to their school and the people in it, via the outlet of video tapes (including the Hitmen for Hire and Basement videos), school reports, and the media-hyped journals and diaries, wherein Eric detailed out floorplans of Columbine and noted when the lunch room was most crowded (see more of Eric's writings). In the videos he and Dylan shot in Eric's basement bedroom (wherein they showed off the way their weapons fit under their trenchcoats) he and Dylan both go off about the 'stuck up bitches' they go to school with, Dylan referring to two by name: Rachel and Jen (during the shootings Rachel Scott was killed and Jennifer Doyle was badly wounded). This sound clip excerpted from the videos was censored by the media due to the cursing so it's hard to understand but if you listen closely you can hear the gist of it.</p>
