      <p><strong>Eric "Reb" Harris</strong></p>
      <p>Eric David Harris (called "Reb" by himself and Klebold) was born April 9th, 1981. He was born to Wayne Nelson Harris and Katherine (Kathy) Ann Harris in Wichita, Kansas. His family had moved many times on account of his father being in the Air Force. The final place his family moved before living in Colorado was Plattsburgh, New York.</p>
      <p>While living in New York, Harris had seemed like a good, normal kid. He had played baseball, and had friends. Once moving to Littleton, however, he began to change slightly (1993). He had gone from baseball to soccer and also had trouble fitting in at his new school. </p>
      <p>Ken Caryl Middle School is where Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had met (7th/8th grade) and quickly became good friends. In their sophomore year of high school (1997), Harris and Klebold were arrested for breaking into a van. Both were released early, however, due to how well they did in the juvenile diversion program they had to attend.</p>
      <p>That same year, Harris and Klebold were found a job at Blackjack Pizza. Together Eric and Dylan got into a lot of mischief at Blackjack Pizza: They set off fireworks in the back alley, they booby-trapped the fence, and they even set a fire in the sink of the kitchen once.</p>
